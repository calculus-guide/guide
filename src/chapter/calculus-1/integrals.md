# Integrals

## What is Integrals?

Integral calculus helps in finding the anti-derivatives of a function. These anti-derivatives are also called the integrals of the function. The process of finding the anti-derivative of a function is called integration. The inverse process of finding derivatives is finding the integrals. The integral of a function represents a family of curves. Finding both derivatives and integrals form the fundamental calculus.

Given a function, \\(f\left( x \right)\\), **an anti-derivative of** \\(f\left( x \right)\\) is any function \\(F\left( x \right)\\) such that
$$F'\left( x \right) = f\left( x \right)$$
If \\(F\left( x \right)\\) is any anti-derivative of \\(f\left( x \right)\\) then the most general anti-derivative of \\(f\left( x \right)\\) is called an **indefinite integral** and denoted,
$$\int{{f\left( x \right)\,dx}} = F\left( x \right) + c\hspace{0.25in}\,c{\mbox{ is an arbitrary constant}}$$
In this definition the \\(\int{{}}\\) is called the **integral symbol**, \\(f\left( x \right)\\) is called the **integrand**, \\(x\\) is called the integration variable and the "\\(c\\)" is called the **constant of integration**.

## Example of Integral

$$
\int \sin^3(x) e^{-5x} dx
$$
