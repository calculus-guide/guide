# Derivatives

## What is Derivatives?

In calculus, a derivative is a mathematical operation that describes how a function changes as its input variables (such as x in the equation f(x)) are varied. The derivative of a function at a given point is a measure of the slope of the function at that point, and it can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}
$$

This formula shows that the derivative of a function is the slope of the tangent line to the function at a given point. In other words, it represents the rate at which the output of the function (y) changes as the input (x) changes.

## Example of Derivatives

$$\frac{d}{dx} (\log_5 (x))^{x/2}$$
