## Differention Formulas

Differentiation formulas are mathematical relationships that allow us to find the derivative of a function in terms of other functions or variables. They are a useful tool in calculus for finding the derivative of functions that are not easily differentiated using the standard rules of calculus.

Here are some common differentiation formulas:

    The power rule: The power rule states that the derivative of a function of the form $f(x) = x^n$ is given by:

$$\frac{d}{dx} x^n = nx^{n-1}$$

    The constant multiple rule: The constant multiple rule states that the derivative of a function of the form $f(x) = c \cdot g(x)$ is given by:

$$\frac{d}{dx} (c \cdot g(x)) = c \cdot \frac{d}{dx} g(x)$$

where $c$ is a constant.

    The sum rule: The sum rule states that the derivative of a function of the form $f(x) = g(x) + h(x)$ is given by:

$$\frac{d}{dx} (g(x) + h(x)) = \frac{d}{dx} g(x) + \frac{d}{dx} h(x)$$

    The product rule: The product rule states that the derivative of a function of the form $f(x) = g(x) \cdot h(x)$ is given by:

$$\frac{d}{dx} (g(x) \cdot h(x)) = g(x) \cdot \frac{d}{dx} h(x) + h(x) \cdot \frac{d}{dx} g(x)$$

These are just a few examples of common differentiation formulas. There are many other formulas that are used to find the derivative of different types of functions, such as the quotient rule, the chain rule, and the implicit differentiation rule.
