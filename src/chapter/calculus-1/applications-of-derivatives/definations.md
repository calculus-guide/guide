# Important definitions

## Stationary Point

A **stationary point** of a differentiable function $f(x)$ is a point $x_0$ on the graph of the function where the function's derivative is zero: $f'(x_0)=0$.

## Critical Point

A critical point of a function is a point on the graph of the function where the derivative is either zero or undefined.

$$c \in \{x \in \text{domain of } f(x) : f'(x)=0 \text{ or } f'(x) \text{ is undefined}\}$$

## Saddle Point

Stationary point which is nether maxima nor minima.
