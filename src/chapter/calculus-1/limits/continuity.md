# Continuity

## What is Continuity?

continuity is a property of a function that describes how the function behaves at different points in its domain. A function is considered continuous if it is defined for all values of its input variables and if it has a finite and well-defined output value for all of those inputs. This means that there are no "jumps" or "breaks" in the function, and that the output of the function changes smoothly as the input is varied.

Mathematically, a function is considered continuous at a given point if the following two conditions are met:

- The function is defined at the point (i.e., it is not undefined or infinite).

- The limit of the function as the input approaches the point is equal to the value of the function at the point. This can be written mathematically as follows:

$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)
$$

Where a is the point at which the function is being evaluated for continuity, and f(x) is the function itself. If this limit exists and is equal to the value of the function at the point, then the function is considered continuous at that point.
