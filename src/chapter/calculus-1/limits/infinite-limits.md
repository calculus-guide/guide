# Infinite Limits

## Infinite Limits

An infinite limit is a type of limit that describes how a function behaves as the input values approach a specific point from one side or the other, but never actually reach that point. This can occur if the function has an unbounded output value as the input approaches the point, or if the function becomes undefined at the point.

In general, an infinite limit is represented by the symbol ±∞, where the sign indicates whether the limit is approached from the left or the right. For example, if a function f(x) has an infinite limit as x approaches a point a from the left, this can be written mathematically as follows:

$$
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = -\infty
$$

Similarly, if a function f(x) has an infinite limit as x approaches a point a from the right, this can be written mathematically as follows:

$$
\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \infty
$$

In both cases, the symbol ±∞ indicates that the function has an unbounded output value as the input approaches the point a, but never actually reaches it. Infinite limits are often encountered in calculus when working with functions that have vertical asymptotes or other types of singularities at certain points in their domain.
