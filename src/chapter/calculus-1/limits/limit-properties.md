# Limit Properties

## Properties of Limits

Limit properties are a set of rules and principles that describe how the limit of a function can be calculated or estimated based on the limits of other functions. These properties allow mathematicians to manipulate and simplify expressions involving limits, and to evaluate limits that might otherwise be difficult or impossible to calculate directly.

Some of the most important limit properties include the following:

- The limit of a constant is the constant itself. This means that if a function f(x) is a constant value c, then the limit of f(x) as x approaches some value a is also c. This can be written mathematically as follows:

$$
\lim_{x \to a} c = c
$$

- The limit of the sum (or difference) of two functions is equal to the sum (or difference) of the limits of those functions. This means that if f(x) and g(x) are two functions, and if the limits of f(x) and g(x) as x approaches a are L and M, respectively, then the limit of their sum or difference is equal to L + M or L - M, as appropriate. This can be written mathematically as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\lim_{x \to a} [f(x) + g(x)] &= \lim_{x \to a} f(x) + \lim_{x \to a} g(x) \
\lim_{x \to a} [f(x) - g(x)] &= \lim_{x \to a} f(x) - \lim_{x \to a} g(x)
\end{aligned}
$$

- The limit of a product (or quotient) of two functions is equal to the product (or quotient) of the limits of those functions, provided the denominator of the quotient is not equal to zero. This means that if f(x) and g(x) are two functions, and if the limits of f(x) and g(x) as x approaches a are L and M, respectively, then the limit of their product or quotient is equal to L * M or L / M, as appropriate. This can be written mathematically as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\lim_{x \to a} [f(x) * g(x)] &= \lim_{x \to a} f(x) * \lim_{x \to a} g(x) \
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} &= \frac{\lim_{x \to a} f(x)}{\lim_{x \to a} g(x)}
\end{aligned}
$$

These properties provide a set of rules and principles that can be used to manipulate and simplify expressions involving limits, and to evaluate limits that might otherwise be difficult or impossible to calculate directly.
