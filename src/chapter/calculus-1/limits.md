# Limits

## What is Limits?

Limits in maths are defined as the values that a function approaches the output for the given input values. Limits play a vital role in calculus and mathematical analysis and are used to define integrals, derivatives, and continuity. It is used in the analysis process, and it always concerns the behavior of the function at a particular point. The limit of a sequence is further generalized in the concept of the limit of a topological net and related to the limit and direct limit in the theory category. Generally, the integrals are classified into two types namely, definite and indefinite integrals. For definite integrals, the upper limit and lower limits are defined properly. Whereas indefinite integrals are expressed without limits, and it will have an arbitrary constant while integrating the function.

Let \\(\(f\left( x \right)\)\\) be a function defined on an interval that contains \\(\(x = a\)\\), except possibly at \\(\(x = a\)\\). Then we say that, $$\[\mathop {\lim }\limits_{x \to a} f\left( x \right) = L\]$$
if for every number \\(\(\varepsilon > 0\)\\) there is some number \\(\(\delta > 0\)\\) 
such that

$$ \[\left| {f\left( x \right) - L} \right| < \varepsilon \hspace{0.5in}{\mbox{whenever}}\hspace{0.5in}0 < \left| {x - a} \right| < \delta \] $$


## Where Limits is been used?

## Example of Limits

$$
\lim_{x \to \pi} \sin(x/2+ \sin(x))
$$

## Solving Limits with python
